# Todo List REST API

This Spring Boot project is a RESTful API with an integrated database for managing a todo list. It provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for todos through the following endpoints.

- **GET** `/todos`: Retrieve a list of all todos.
- **POST** `/todos`: Create a new todo.
- **PATCH** `/todos/{id}`: Update a todo (e.g., mark it as completed or uncompleted).
- **DELETE** `/todos/{id}`: Delete a todo by its UUID.

The API is hosted at `https://swiftask-api.onrender.com/projects`.

You can find the code for the front end at `https://github.com/guchierrez/swiftask-front-end`.
